# Weighted (causal) partial dependence plots

This repository serves two purposes. First and foremost, it is the working repository for the weighted (causal) partial dependence plot first introduced by [Lazzari, Alvarez, and Ruggieri (2022)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41060-022-00329-w) [1]. The goal is to formalize further the wPDP under the risk of sample selection bias via causal reasoning. The current repository is, thus, work in progress.

Second, this repository presents the general pipeline of said paper. It does so to meet the goals of a [NoBIAS ITN](https://nobias-project.eu/) testbed. The original code used for the paper is kept in a separate, private repository due to the paper's use of proprietary data. The code presented here (denoted with the prefix *lar* for Lazzari, Alvarez, and Ruggieri) nonetheless provides an almost exact implementation of the paper's general pipeline.
